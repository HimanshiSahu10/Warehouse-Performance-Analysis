# Warehouse & Shipment Analysis and Forecasting 
In the fast-paced logistics industry, **efficiency** and **accuracy** in warehouse operations, shipments, and **sales forecasting** are critical. This dashboard visualization provides data-driven insights into key metrics like:

âœ… **Warehouse Performance** - Tracking total revenue, shipment trends, and order fulfillment

âœ… **Sales & Revenue Forecasting** - Predicting future revenue using Power BIâ€™s Time Series forecasting

âœ… **Shipment & Logistics Optimization** - Analyzing completed, active, and returned shipments

âœ… **Supply Chain Efficiency** - Identifying delays, return trends, and delivery time across regions


This project uses *Power BI* and *SQL* to analyze **real-world sales** & **logistics data**, delivering actionable insights for **supply chain improvements**.

## ðŸ“Š Results & Key Findings (Insights from the Analysis)

*Based on the analysis of warehouse performance, sales trends, and shipment efficiency, here are the major findings from the project:*

### 1. Revenue & Sales Performance:

âœ… **Total Revenue:** The business generated **$2.7M** in total revenue over the analyzed period.

âœ… **Peak Sales Period:** The highest sales occurred in **May** and **September**, indicating seasonal demand.

âœ… **Category Performance:** **Electronics** & **Audio** Products contributed 45%+ of total revenue.


### 2. Warehouse Efficiency & Shipment Trends

âœ… **Total Shipments Processed**: **5K** orders were shipped across multiple regions.

âœ… **Avg. Delivery Time:** The overall average delivery time was **10** days, but varied by region like Asia had **15** days average delivery time while **North America** had **2** days average delivery time.

âœ… **Return Shipments:** **5%** of total shipments were returned, impacting revenue.

**Major reasons:** *Delayed deliveries, defective products, and customer cancellations.*

âœ… **Top Performing Regions:**

North America & South America had the fastest shipment processing times.(2-4 days avg)

Asia  & Oceania had slower delivery times (10+ days avg.), indicating possible inefficiencies.

### 3. Shipment & Logistics Optimization

âœ… **Delay Analysis:**

20% of orders faced delays, with regional warehouses contributing to 70% of them.

Major causes: Stock shortages, last-mile delivery issues, and poor route optimization.

âœ… **Details and Pictures of Sales Persons:** Data along with pictures of the sales person have been recorded to keep a record of the number of Completed , Active and Returned Shipments done by the person.
